<objective>
Add glass styling to three Card components that were missed during the visual consistency audit.

Purpose: Close VERIFICATION.md gap - "User experiences consistent playful personality across all screens" is blocked because StreakCard, WeeklyChart, and TaskListItem Cards appear solid while other Cards on the same pages have glassmorphism effect.

Output: All Card components in the app have consistent glass styling.

  <name>Task 1: Add glass class to StreakCard</name>
  <files>src/components/insights/streak-card.tsx</files>
  <action>
    Line 18: Add `glass` class to the Card component.

    Change:
    `<Card className="hover:shadow-md transition-shadow duration-200">`

    To:
    `<Card className="glass hover:shadow-md transition-shadow duration-200">`

    Keep existing hover and transition classes - just add glass at the start.
  </action>
  <verify>grep "glass" src/components/insights/streak-card.tsx shows the class is present</verify>

    Line 35: Add className with `glass` class to the Card component.

    Change:
    `<Card>`

    To:
    `<Card className="glass">`

    This Card had no className at all, so simply add one.

  <files>src/components/tasks/task-list-item.tsx</files>
  <action>
    Lines 50-52: Add `glass` to the cn() call on the Card component.

    Change:
    ```tsx
    <Card className={cn(
      'transition-all duration-200 hover:shadow-md animate-slide-up',
      !task.isActive && 'opacity-60'
    )}>
    ```

    To:
    ```tsx
    <Card className={cn(
      'glass transition-all duration-200 hover:shadow-md animate-slide-up',
      !task.isActive && 'opacity-60'
    )}>
    ```

    Add `glass` at the start of the first string in cn() - before transition-all.
  </action>
  <verify>grep "glass" src/components/tasks/task-list-item.tsx shows the class is present</verify>
  <done>TaskListItem has glass class on Card component</done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
Before declaring plan complete:
- [ ] `npm run build` succeeds without errors
- [ ] All three files contain `glass` class on Card components
- [ ] No TypeScript errors introduced
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- All tasks completed
- All verification checks pass
- Glass class present in all three component files
- Build passes
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/05-polish-consistency/05-04-SUMMARY.md`
