<objective>
Create visual concept mockups for user to review before committing to a visual direction.

Purpose: The user explicitly wants to see design concepts (gradients vs flat vs glassmorphism) before implementation. This phase creates static mockups showing how each style would look applied to HabitStreak's key UI elements.

Output: Three HTML mockup files the user can open in a browser to compare visual styles and make a decision.

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create gradient style concept mockup</name>
  <files>docs/visual-concepts/gradient-concept.html</files>
  <action>
Create a self-contained HTML file showing the "Vibrant Gradients" visual style:

**Style characteristics:**
- Bold gradient backgrounds (blue-to-purple, pink-to-orange)
- Gradient buttons that shift on hover
- Soft shadows with colored glows
- Rounded corners (larger radius)
- Vibrant, saturated colors

**Mockup content:**
1. Header showing "HabitStreak" with gradient text
2. Task list with 3 example tasks (2 pending, 1 completed)
3. Completed task showing gradient checkmark and subtle glow
4. Streak counter section with flame icon
5. Bottom navigation bar

**Technical approach:**
- Single HTML file with embedded CSS (no external dependencies)
- Use CSS gradients, box-shadows with color
- Show both blue and pink color scheme variants (side by side or toggle)
- Mobile-first layout (max-width: 400px centered)
- Include brief "Style: Vibrant Gradients" label at top for identification
  </action>
  <verify>Open docs/visual-concepts/gradient-concept.html in browser, verify gradient effects are visible</verify>
  <done>Gradient mockup shows task list, completion state, and streak with colorful gradient styling</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Create flat/bold style concept mockup</name>
  <files>docs/visual-concepts/flat-concept.html</files>
  <action>
Create a self-contained HTML file showing the "Bold Flat" visual style:

**Style characteristics:**
- Solid, saturated flat colors (no gradients)
- High contrast color blocks
- Sharp or slightly rounded corners
- Bold typography with strong weight
- Minimal shadows (flat aesthetic)
- Strong accent colors that pop

**Mockup content:**
1. Header showing "HabitStreak" in bold sans-serif
2. Task list with 3 example tasks (2 pending, 1 completed)
3. Completed task showing bold checkmark with solid background
4. Streak counter section with flat flame icon
5. Bottom navigation bar

**Technical approach:**
- Single HTML file with embedded CSS
- Use solid colors, minimal box-shadows
- Strong visual hierarchy through color contrast
- Show both blue and pink color scheme variants
- Mobile-first layout (max-width: 400px centered)
- Include "Style: Bold Flat" label at top
  </action>
  <verify>Open docs/visual-concepts/flat-concept.html in browser, verify flat bold design is visible</verify>
  <done>Flat mockup shows task list, completion state, and streak with bold solid color styling</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Create glassmorphism style concept mockup</name>
  <files>docs/visual-concepts/glass-concept.html</files>
  <action>
Create a self-contained HTML file showing the "Glassmorphism" visual style:

**Style characteristics:**
- Frosted glass effect (backdrop-blur)
- Semi-transparent backgrounds with blur
- Subtle borders (glass edge effect)
- Soft gradients in backgrounds behind glass elements
- Light/airy feel with depth

**Mockup content:**
1. Header showing "HabitStreak" on glass panel
2. Task list with 3 example tasks on glass cards
3. Completed task showing checkmark with glass glow effect
4. Streak counter section with glass panel
5. Bottom navigation bar with glass effect

**Technical approach:**
- Single HTML file with embedded CSS
- Use backdrop-filter: blur() for glass effect
- Semi-transparent backgrounds (rgba or hsla)
- Subtle gradient backgrounds behind glass panels
- Show both blue and pink color scheme variants
- Mobile-first layout (max-width: 400px centered)
- Include "Style: Glassmorphism" label at top

**Note:** Add fallback styles for browsers without backdrop-filter support
  </action>
  <verify>Open docs/visual-concepts/glass-concept.html in browser, verify glass blur effect is visible</verify>
  <done>Glass mockup shows task list, completion state, and streak with frosted glass styling</done>

<task type="checkpoint:human-verify" gate="blocking">
  <what-built>Three visual concept mockups showing different style directions for HabitStreak</what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
    1. Open docs/visual-concepts/gradient-concept.html in browser
    2. Open docs/visual-concepts/flat-concept.html in browser
    3. Open docs/visual-concepts/glass-concept.html in browser
    4. Compare the three styles side by side
    5. Consider: Which style best matches the "playful, celebratory" vision?
    6. Consider: Which style will look best with animations and confetti?

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 5: Document visual direction decision</name>
  <files>.planning/PROJECT.md</files>
  <action>
After user makes their choice, update PROJECT.md:

1. Update the Key Decisions table with the visual direction choice:
   - Decision: "Visual direction: [chosen style]"
   - Rationale: "[user's reasoning if provided]"
   - Outcome: "Proceeding with [style] approach"

2. If user chose a hybrid (e.g., "gradient with some glass elements"), document the specifics.

3. Mark VISUAL-04 requirement as addressed in the Active section comment.

This task executes AFTER the checkpoint — the user's choice determines what to document.
  </action>
  <verify>grep "Visual direction" .planning/PROJECT.md shows the documented decision</verify>
  <done>Visual direction decision documented in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table</done>

Before declaring plan complete:
- [ ] All three mockup HTML files exist and open in browser
- [ ] Each mockup clearly shows the style's distinctive characteristics
- [ ] User has reviewed all three concepts
- [ ] User has made a choice
- [ ] Choice is documented in PROJECT.md
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- Three distinct visual concept mockups created (gradient, flat, glass)
- Each mockup shows key UI elements: task list, completed task, streak counter
- User has reviewed and chosen a visual direction
- Decision documented in PROJECT.md with rationale
- Phase requirement VISUAL-04 satisfied
</success_criteria>
