## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded. Documented to prevent scope creep.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Pricing section | Self-hosted, no paid tiers |
| User count stats | Personal app, not SaaS |
| Newsletter signup | Not a marketing business |
| Testimonials | No external users for self-hosted |
| Live chat widget | Self-hosted, you are the support |
| Interactive demo | HIGH complexity, defer to v2 |
| Video walkthrough | Production effort, defer to v2 |
