## Tech Debt

## Deferred to v2

These items were explicitly scoped out of v1.3:

| Item | Reason |
|------|--------|
| Maskable PWA icons | Requires redesigned artwork for adaptive icons |
| "How It Works" section | Landing page MVP sufficient |
| Micro-animations (parallax, hover effects) | Polish item, not essential |
| Interactive demo | High complexity |
| Video walkthrough | Production effort |

## Commits (v1.3)

| 12 | fac1eeb, 3d07959, acc32f2, 1e0454e, 2e73cda |

1. **Visual appearance** - Landing, login, signup pages look correct
2. **Responsive layout** - Pages adapt correctly on mobile
3. **PWA install** - Android Chrome install prompt works
4. **iOS bookmark** - Apple touch icon displays on home screen
