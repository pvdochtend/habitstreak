## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded. Documented to prevent scope creep.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Sound effects | User preference varies widely; research recommends visual-first |
| 365-day milestone | Need users to reach 100 days first; defer to v3+ |
| Achievement badge system | Full gamification adds complexity; keep v1 focused |
| Custom Lottie animations | 82KB+ bundle impact; CSS/Motion sufficient for v1 |
| @tsparticles backgrounds | React 19 compatibility uncertain; use simpler approach |
| Share cards | Social features deferred to v2 |
