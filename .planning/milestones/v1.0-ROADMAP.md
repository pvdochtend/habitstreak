# Milestone v1.0: HabitStreak UI Refresh

**Status:** SHIPPED 2026-01-18
**Phases:** 1-5
**Total Plans:** 16

## Overview

Transform HabitStreak from a functional but dull habit tracker into a playful, celebratory experience. Starting with visual direction exploration, then building performance-safe animation infrastructure, followed by rewarding task completion interactions, streak celebrations, and finally polishing the entire experience to feel consistently fun.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Visual Identity Exploration

**Goal**: Establish visual direction through design concepts before committing to implementation
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase)
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 01-01: Create visual concept mockups for user review (glassmorphism chosen)

**Details:**
Three self-contained HTML mockups created (gradient, flat, glass). User reviewed all three and chose glassmorphism for its modern depth and elegant appearance.

---

### Phase 2: Animation Foundation

**Goal**: Performance-safe animation infrastructure with accessibility support
**Depends on**: Phase 1 (visual direction informs color choices)
**Plans**: 4 plans (including gap closure)

Plans:
- [x] 02-01: Color & glass foundation (vibrant palette, glassmorphism utilities)
- [x] 02-02: Animation feedback & transitions (button feedback, shimmer skeletons, page transitions)
- [x] 02-03: Motion sensitivity & verification (prefers-reduced-motion, visual checkpoint)
- [x] 02-04: UAT gap closure (glow-blink fix, hover glow, page transition visibility)

**Details:**
Established 94-95% saturation colors, glass utility classes (.glass, .glass-subtle, .glass-strong), button feedback (active:scale-[0.97]), shimmer skeletons, PageTransition component (16px slide-up), comprehensive reduced-motion support.

### Phase 3: Task Completion Experience

**Goal**: Rewarding task check-in interactions that spark joy
**Depends on**: Phase 2 (uses animation foundation)
**Plans**: 5 plans

Plans:
- [x] 03-01: Implement checkmark animation and color fill
- [x] 03-02: Add particle burst and haptic feedback
- [x] 03-03: Integrate small confetti on task completion
- [x] 03-04: Implement optimistic UI for instant feedback
- [x] 03-05: Fix mobile touch state issues

**Details:**
AnimatedCheckmark component with SVG stroke draw, CelebrationEffect with radial particles, canvas-confetti integration (~3KB), haptic feedback utility, optimistic UI pattern with error rollback, mobile touch state fixes using @media (hover: hover).

---

### Phase 4: Celebrations & Streaks

**Goal**: Full celebration system and streak visualizations
**Depends on**: Phase 3 (builds on celebration patterns)
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 04-01: Implement all-tasks-done celebration
- [x] 04-02: Add streak counter animation and flame icon

**Details:**
usePrevious hook for transition detection, fireAllTasksConfetti on daily goal completion, AnimatedStreakNumber with CSS rolling (0-99 range), AnimatedFlame with flicker (1.5s) and glow (2s) animations.

---

### Phase 5: Polish & Consistency

**Goal**: Unified playful personality across all screens
**Depends on**: Phase 4 (final polish after core features)
**Plans**: 4 plans (including gap closures)

Plans:
- [x] 05-01: Implement animated background component (CSS floating orbs)
- [x] 05-02: Visual consistency audit and targeted fixes + verification
- [x] 05-03: Fix background visibility (inline HSL styles)
- [x] 05-04: Glass styling gap closure (StreakCard, WeeklyChart, TaskListItem)

**Details:**
AnimatedBackground component with three floating orbs (25s/18s/12s timing), theme-aware colors using inline HSL styles, glass styling applied to all Card components for consistent glassmorphism.

## Milestone Summary

**Decimal Phases:** None (all work was planned from start)

**Key Decisions:**
- Visual direction: Glassmorphism (user chose from three mockups)
- Pure CSS animations over libraries (bundle size, GPU acceleration)
- canvas-confetti for celebrations (~3KB, realistic physics)
- Optimistic UI for instant task completion feedback
- Per-digit number rolling for professional polish
- Three-tier float timing for organic background feel
- Inline HSL styles to avoid Tailwind JIT purging

**Issues Resolved:**
- PageTransition not integrated into pages (fixed in 02-03)
- Mobile sticky hover states (fixed in 03-05)
- Background orbs not visible (Tailwind JIT purging - fixed in 05-03)
- Glass styling missing on some Cards (fixed in 05-04)
- Glow-blink artifact on task completion (fixed in 02-04)

**Issues Deferred:**
- Streak calculation weekend/weekday mismatch (captured as pending todo)
- Flame animation visibility enhancement (captured as pending todo)

**Technical Debt Incurred:**
- None identified
